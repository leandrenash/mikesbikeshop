# mikesbikeshop
for Web Development

So a little brief breakdown about the website, 

Home
At the homepage you find a brief outline of the dress and number and email , basically a place where the user can see info on how to get to Mikes Shop,

Contact Us
We have a form that allows user to enter their name, email, phone number and leave a massage for the company.

Option

This was the second page made to allow users to see or view bikes that are in stock at the store and a pricing and the make of the bikes


Problems occurred 
I wasn’t getting the options tab to show the images for some reason not sure why but doing some changes but because of deadline uploaded it but making changes and should update it in time to come

Things to improve
= be responsive to all devices 
=format the grid properly for images etc
=get images uploaded and shown properly 
=design needs to be more attractive to users.
